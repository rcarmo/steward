# Copilot-like starter prompts

Use these as initial user prompts with the harness to mirror common Copilot flows:

- "Summarize this repository and list key files to inspect next."
- "Search for TODOs and note the files and line numbers."
- "Read the README and propose next implementation steps."
- "Find the test command and run it. Report failures."
- "Locate the main entry point and explain the runtime flow."
- "Apply a small patch to fix any obvious lint issues you find."
- "List todo items, add one for {task}, and mark it done."
- "Fetch this URL and give me the first paragraph: {url}."
